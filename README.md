# particle_simulator
This is a MATLAB app. It simulates motion of a charged particle in user defined electric and magnetic field. The fields can be input as equations dependent on cartesian coordinate variables (x, y, z) and time (t).

It uses Boris Push method to calculate the path of the particle.

To run the particle simulator, you need MATLAB or MATLAB Runtime.

**Start** Button: It starts the simulation and produces the results.

**Export Data** Button: Opens up a save dialog for saving data of t, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz in multiple formats.
